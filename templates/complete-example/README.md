# Attention!
This config is an example. This represents a real-world use-case.

This repo contains three systems, two profiles, and a bunch of patches, simulating the conditions of a user who gets really hard at the slightest thought of ricing his setup but is somehow scared of using NixOS unstable.

If you're wondering, this is what we're patching nixpkgs with:
* https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/476302
* https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/391574

You can now live in the shoes of a Linux user who, presumably, has zero idea of what he's doing.
