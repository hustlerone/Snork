# Attention!
This config is really barebones. This really does not showcase how much easier your life would get.

However, if you are migrating from a traditional NixOS config, dragging and dropping the contents of /etc/nixos into a subfolder (whose name is your computer's hostName) under ./systems (the configured systems folder) is all you need to get it to work here.

I guess if you're that person it's going to be a relief knowing that you can now have your laptop in the same monolithic repo. Eh, I'd doubt that you've even considered setting up a git repo for your config.
